## ⚠️ Important Notes for iPhone

### 1. Use Safari Only
- ❌ Chrome on iPhone won't work properly
- ✅ Safari is required for PWA installation

### 2. Login Duration
- Login lasts 2-3 weeks typically
- If you use app daily, stays logged in longer
- If iOS clears data, just login again

### 3. Offline Mode
- Works, but limited compared to Android
- Visit pages while online first
- They'll be available offline later

### 4. Regular Use Helps
- Use the app daily
- iOS keeps data for frequently used apps
- Inactive apps may lose session sooner

---

## 🔄 If Session Expires

**What happens:**
- App opens but asks for login
- Normal behavior on iOS

**What to do:**
1. Login again
2. Session restored for 2-3+ weeks
3. Continue using normally

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Can't find "Add to Home Screen"
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're in Safari (not Chrome)
- Tap Share button at bottom (not top)
- Scroll down in the menu
- Option should be there

### Icon doesn't appear
**Solution:**
- Try again from beginning
- Make sure you tapped "Add" at the end
- Check all home screen pages
- Restart iPhone if needed

### Keeps asking to login
**Solution:**
- iOS cleared the data (normal)
- Login again
- Try to use app more frequently
- Consider updating to latest iOS

### App doesn't work offline
**Solution:**
- Visit pages while online first
- iOS needs to cache them
- Then they work offline
- Not as robust as Android

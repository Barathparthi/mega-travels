# Screenshots Directory

This directory is for PWA screenshots that appear in the install dialog.

## Recommended Screenshot

Take a screenshot of the driver dashboard (540x720 pixels) and save it as `dashboard.png` in this directory.

### How to Create:

1. Open the driver dashboard on a mobile device or in Chrome DevTools (mobile view)
2. Set viewport to 360x640 or similar mobile size
3. Take a screenshot
4. Resize to 540x720 using any image editor
5. Save as `dashboard.png` here

### Why?

This screenshot will appear when users install the PWA, giving them a preview of the app.

### Optional

You can also add more screenshots:
- `add-entry.png` - Entry form screen
- `profile.png` - Driver profile screen
- `tripsheet.png` - Tripsheet view

These will show in the install dialog carousel on supported devices.
